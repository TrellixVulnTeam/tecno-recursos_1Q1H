Each internally compensated operational amplifier has well matched high voltage JFET input devices for low input offset voltage. The JFET technology provides wide bandwidths and fast slew rates with low input bias currents, input offset currents, and supply currents. These devices are available in single, dual and quad operational amplifiers which are pin–compatible with the industry standard MC1741, MC1458, and the MC3403/LM324 bipolar devices. • Input Offset Voltage of 5.0 mV Max (LF347B) • Low Input Bias Current: 50 pA • Low Input Noise Voltage: 16 nV/ Hz • Wide Gain Bandwidth: 4.0 MHz • High Slew Rate: 13V/μs • Low Supply Current: 1.8 mA per Amplifier • High Input Impedance: 10 12 Ω • High Common Mode and Supply Voltage Rejection Ratios: 100 dB MAXIMUM RATINGS Rating Symbol Value Unit Supply Voltage V CC +18 V V EE –18 Differential Input Voltage V ID ±30 V Input Voltage Range (Note 1) V IDR ±15 V Output Short Circuit Duration (Note 2) t SC Continuous Power Dissipation at T A = +25°C P D 900 mW Derate above T A =+25°C 1/ θJA 10 mW/°C Operating Ambient Temperature Range T A 0 to +70 °C Operating Junction Temperature Range T J 115 °C Storage Temperature Range T stg – 65 to +150 °C NOTES: 1. Unless otherwise specified, the absolute maximum negative input voltage is limited to the negative power supply. 2. Any amplifier output can be shorted to ground indefinitely. However, if more than one amplifier output is shorted simultaneously, maximum junction temperature rating may be exceeded.  Motorola, Inc. 1996 Rev 0 ","LF347, B LF351 LF353 2 MOTOROLA ANALOG IC DEVICE DATA ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS (V CC = +15 V EE = –15 V, T A = 25°C, unless otherwise noted.)

NOTE: 3. Input bias currents of JFET input op amps approximately double for every 10°C rise in junction temperature. To maintain junction temperatures as close to ambient as is possible, pulse techniques are utilized during test. ","LF347, B LF351 LF353 3 MOTOROLA ANALOG IC DEVICE DATA OUTLINE DIMENSIONS NOTES: 1.
