It incorporates well matched, high voltage J-FET and bipolar transistors on a monolithic integrated circuit. The device features high slew rates, low input bias and offset current, and low offset voltage temperature coefficient.  FEATURES *Low power consumption *Wide common-mode (up to V CC +) and differential voltage range *Low input bias and offset current *Low noise eN = 15 (typ) *Output short-circuit protection *High input impedance J-FET input stage *Low harmonic distortion: 0.01%(typ) *Internal frequency compensation *Latch up free operation DIP-14 SOP-14 Lead-free: TL084L Halogen-free: TL084G  ORDERING INFORMATION Ordering Number Normal Lead Free Plating Halogen Free Package Packing TL084-D14-T TL084L-D14-T TL084G-D14-T DIP-14 Tube TL084-S14-R TL084L-S14-R TL084G-S14-R SOP-14 Tape Reel ","TL084 Preliminary LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT UNISONIC TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD 2 of 5 www.unisonic.com.tw QW-R105-035,a  PIN CONFIGURATIONS ","TL084 Preliminary LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT UNISONIC TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD 3 of 5 www.unisonic.com.tw QW-R105-035,a  SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM ","TL084 Preliminary LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT UNISONIC TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD 4 of 5 www.unisonic.com.tw QW-R105-035,a  ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS (Ta=25°C) PARAMETER SYMBOL RATING UNIT Supply Voltage (Note 2) V CC ±18 V Input Voltage (Note 3) V IN ±15 V Differential Input Voltage (Note 4) V I(DIFF) ±30 V Power Dissipation P D 680 mW Output Short-Circuit Duration (Note 5) Infinite Operating Temperature T OPR 0 ~ +70 °C Storage Temperature T STG -65 ~ +150 °C Notes: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Absolute maximum ratings are those values beyond which the device could be permanently damaged. Absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only and functional device operation is not implied. All voltage values, except differential voltage, are with respect to the zero reference level (ground) of the supply voltages where the zero reference level is the midpoint between V CC - and V CC +. The magnitude of the input voltage must never exceed the magnitude of the supply voltage or 15 volts, whichever is less. Differential voltages are at the non-inverting input terminal with respect to the inverting input terminal. The output may be shorted to ground or to either supply. Temperature and/or supply voltages must be limited to ensure that the dissipation rating is not exceeded.  ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS (V CC =±15V, T a =25°C, unless otherwise specified) PARAMETER SYMBOL TEST CONDITIONS MIN TYP MAX UNIT Input Offset Voltage V I(OFF) R S ≦10kΩ, V CM =0V 5 15 mV Temperature Coefficient of Input Offset Voltage ΔV I(OFF) R S =50Ω 10 μV/°C Input Offset Current (Note) I I(OFF) V CM =0V 5 200 pA Input Bias Current (Note1) I I(BIAS) V CM =0V 30 400 pA Input Common Mode Voltage V I(CM) ±10 -12~+15 V Output Voltage Swing V O(SW) R L =10kΩ 24 28 V Large Signal Voltage Gain G V R L ≧2kΩ, V OUT =±10V 25 150 V/mV Gain Bandwidth Product GB W 1 MHz Input Resistance R IN 10 12 Ω Common Mode Rejection Ratio CMR R S ≦10kΩ 70 100 dB Supply Voltage Rejection Ratio SVR R S ≦10kΩ 70 100 dB Supply Current I CC No Load 1.4 2.8 mA Channel Separation V01/V02 G V =100 120 dB Slew Rate SR V IN =10V, R L =2kΩ, C L =100pF, unity gain 2.0 V/μs Rise Time t R 0.1 μs Overshoot Factor K OV V IN =20mV, R L =2kΩ, C L =100pF, unity gain 10 % Equivalent Input Noise Voltage eN R S =100Ω, f=1KHz 25 Note: The Input bias currents are junction leakage currents, which approximately double for every 10°C increase in the junction temperature.
